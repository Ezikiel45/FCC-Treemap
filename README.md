# FCC-Treemap
FreeCodeCamp treemap of video game sales


Design a webpage showing video game sales as a treemap. Create html, css and javascript (babel) to display video game sales grouped by platform and sized based on overall sales. Hovering over a box should pop up a floating information box with more information on the game. Page should be responsive and centered with a legend at the bottom corresponding to platform and color.

This project is part of freecodecamp.org certification process.
